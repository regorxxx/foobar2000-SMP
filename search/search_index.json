Imagine Google maps for genre/styles, and looking\nfor the distance from Rock to Jazz for ex. Note this is totally different to simple string matching,\nso 'Acid Rock' may be similar to 'Psychedelic Rock' even if they are totally different tag values \n(or strings). This method is pretty computational intensive.\n\n-DYNGENRE: -&gt; Score + Simplifed Distance Uses a simplification of the GRAPH method.
